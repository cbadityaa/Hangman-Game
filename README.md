# Hangman-Game
This is the classic word guessing game.Here I have created a Fruit Edition of the same. ie,The words you'll be having to guess are the name of different fruits randomly chose by the game.
## Technologies Used
* Python3
## How the Game works?
* <img src="hangman/Image 001.jpg">
* Every time you run the game a new random word is chosen to guess.
* You have only 6 chances to make wrong guesses.<br>

* The guess is made as a single alphabet and for each wrong guess you will get body parts of the hangman one by one.
* You get the complete hangman when you lose all your 6 chances and thus you lose the game.
